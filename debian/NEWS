lp-solve (5.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * From upstreams README.txt:

    "Note that lp2mps and mps2lp don't exist anymore. However this functionality is now implemented
     in lp_solve:

     lp2mps can be simulated as following:
     lp_solve -parse_only -lp infile -wmps outfile

     mps2lp can be simulated as following:
     lp_solve -parse_only -mps infile -wlp outfile"

    Please adapt as necessary.

  * The library has been split out into liblpsove55-dev (and has changed
    the name upstream to liblpsolve55.a). The includes moved to
    /usr/include/lpsolve

  * The library has been fixed to build with the libcolamd from libufsparse
    instead of shipping an own version. You might need to use -lcolamd in
    addition (and install libufsparse-dev)
